# Atea Git manual

Welcome to the GitHub for Atea Norge!

This is a rudimentary manual to help you get going.

# Accounts
* Make sure your GitHub account has [verified the atea.no email](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/verifying-your-email-address)
* Make sure to add your full name to the account

# Naming schemes
* Repositories, branches and teams must use `kebab-case`
* All repositories must have a short, but descriptive name
* All repositories must have a good description, explaining what the repo is used for
* All repositories must have at least one `CODEOWNERS` file, defining who "owns" the code
* All teams must have `dev-`, `ops-`, or `region-` as prefix (where `-region` is a region within Atea Norge). `-dev` is for users that commits code (will have `write` rights), `ops-` for users that will manage the repository (will have `admin` rights).
* Repositories must not have the aforementioned prefix.

# Create new teams and/or repositories
Go to [ateanorge-github/README.md](https://github.com/ateanorge/ateanorge-github/blob/main/README.md) for more information.
